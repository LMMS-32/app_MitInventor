# app_AMIGOS SOLIDARIOS
'Friends of Solidarity' is an application designed to assist the demand of a group of volunteers.
They needed an app where people could pre-enter their donations for the campaigns.
In addition to being able to gather in a single place information on upcoming campaigns, photo gallery, etc.

This application was created using MitApInventor, to show the features and power of this tool.
Created in 2018, for the course MATD02 - Collaborative Systems (Professor Vaninha Vieira http://homes.dcc.ufba.br/~vaninha/), in the Information Systems course (UFBA - Federal University of Bahia)
